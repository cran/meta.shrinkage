Description: Implement meta-analyses for simultaneously estimating individual means with shrinkage,
 isotonic regression and pretests. Include our original implementation of the isotonic regression via the pool-adjacent-violators algorithm (PAVA) algorithm.
 For the pretest estimator, the confidence interval for individual means are provided.
